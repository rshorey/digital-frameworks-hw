# This is a header to show off how markdown works

here is some other stuff

## look a subheader

Under this subheader, we'll have a list

1. list item 1
2. This is actually list item number 2
3. another list item

*italics uses one star*
**bold uses two stars**

In order to see a line break, you need 2 returns.
there's only one return here, and it looks like one line

but there are two returns here
